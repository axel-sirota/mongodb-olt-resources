Chateau Style Brooklyn Loft for Singles or Couples,"Hi, my name is Farrah and I've created a warm and welcoming zen oasis in one of the most exciting new neighborhoods in Brooklyn called Bed Stuy. The setup is perfect for single women coming into town for business, couples looking for a home away from home, or anyone who is looking to have a temporary solid live-work base in Brooklyn. I believe in offering great quality for a fair price, so the cost reflected is a nice compromise that meets both you and me in the middle. SLEEP: There is a master loft that overlooks the entire apartment and is completely open. The window is south facing, so there is a lot of light that comes through in the morning and remains fairly mellow throughout the day.

Magazine SOHO Studio Loft.  Read our reviews!,"SOHO designer's loft space on THE HIPPEST street in NYC (Crosby). Fine linens, 16 foot ceilings, hardwood floors, TONS of light...the VERY best of downtown NYC!!! Hotels on this street start at $800 per night so this is a steal. Every detail has been thought of. BUT, you need to be able to walk up 4 flights of stairs should you rent. We DO NOT rent to more than 2 people so please don't (Website hidden by Airbnb) exceptions.  If you are looking to cook during your stay, this is not the flat/apt for you. We have a microwave, mini refrigerator and coffee maker with mugs. There is not a full kitchen for this rental. TV is Roku based. This rental basically functions like a high-end hotel room. This is a very peaceful building so if you are loud partiers this is not the space for you. This was formally Basquiat's artist loft! This is an alcove studio space designed with the utmost detail creating a dreamy feel to the space.
